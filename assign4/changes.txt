List of changes made to test_process.py

1. removed original MyDict
2. Added three classes: MyOpenLinearDict, MyOpenQuadraticDict, MyOpenChainDict
3. MyOpenLinearDict and MyOpenQuadratic Dict are very similar, only major difference
is within the mhash function, which the rehash function in both programs call to rehash the
hash table

The following were the same for all three hash tables
4. Used a numpy array to create hash table that was able to take in tuples
5. implemented a counter that kept track of how many times the program would rehash
6. added another tuple which contained the key and value for each slot in the hash table
7. added three if/else conditionals that checked if there were any null points in the hash table, and if there were it would increment by 1. 
8. Stored these values and keys within the tuples.
9. Implemented a locate function that would rehash the hash key if it ended up being null, and the table ended up being filled
10.Implemented a getkeyval which checks if the value within the array is null at any point, and adds i to the mydict if this occurs
11. contains, dump weren't changed much from Professors implementation
12. mhash performs the mod for the hash function, while rehash calls upon this function everytime the insert/locate require it

The following were different for the MyOpenLinearDict and the MyOpenQuadraticDict functions.
13. In MyOpenLinearDict, the mhash which performs the mod function for linear probing uses the formula (akey + i) % size
14. In MyOpenQuadraticDict, the mhash which performs the mod function for quadratic probing uses the formula (akey + i + i^2) % size
15. In both of the functions, the constant that we used for i and i^2 was 1.

Miscellaneous Modifications
16. Added three MySet classes, MyOpenQuadraticSet, MyOpenLinearSet, MyOpenChainSet, which can all be called by their Dict counterparts
17. Modified testing functions, so instead of calling out MySet() from the Professor's implementation, it calls out the respective MySet implementations
18. Modified for loop, so called out the respective MySet implementations.
